## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Heya! I go by Rez (short for my name; security purposes and a result of my cybersecurity degree aka "ultimate privacy", which by the way does not exist! Anywayâ€¦) and I'm a Cybersecurity student. I'm into bug bounty, penetration testing, hunting zero-days, ethical hacking, busting drug lords, and documenting my learning journey!

Outside of anything security-related, you'll find me designing websites, UI/UX, and mobile apps, just for fun!
